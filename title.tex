\begin{abstract}
Nested Application Conditions (NACs) are used as a graphical way to express first order formulas ruling the applicability of a graph transformation rule to a given match. We first propose a notion of morphism among NACs which is consistent with the entailment of the corresponding formulas. This lets emerge
a structural weakness of the original definition of NACs, that we overcome by proposing the original notion of Span-Based Conditions, where NACs embeds. We also introduce morphisms for the latter, obtaining a number of categories suitably related by functors.
