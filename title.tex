\begin{abstract}
Nested Application Conditions (NACs) are used as a graphical way to express first order formulas ruling the applicability of a graph transformation rule to a given match. We first propose a notion of morphism among NACs which is consistent with the entailment of the corresponding formulas. This lets emerge
a structural weakness of the original definition of NACs, that we overcome by proposing the original notion of Span-Based Conditions, where NACs embeds. We also introduce morphisms for the latter, showing that they are stricly richer than the former even for the orginal NACs. (??? alternatively, showing that they conservatively extend morphism among the embedded NACs)
