Extension of Festschrift paper to journal version
=================================================
- Extend connection from arrow-based to FOL, so readers can translate examples

- Get rid of the identity shifter if possible

- Add characterisation of conjunction, disjunction, negation and existential for span-based conditions

Journal submission [after FestColloquim]
- include additionally:
  - correspondance between NGC and FOL formulas
  - explicit read-back: from condition to formula
  - from formula to conditions give a construction for and/or/not/exists
  - section on computable entailment 
  - I would like to get rid of I_{X,Y}, the empty shifters. 
- completeness for arrow based conditions - NO
- Existential quantification: relations with backward shift, properties? Adjointness? Not clear. Relation with shift????
- logical characterization of provable entailment ??? sarebbe bello
