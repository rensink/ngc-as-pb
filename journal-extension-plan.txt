Morphisms of span-based conditions

Shifters for an arrow from A to B as commuting span (b,f)
Shifters allow to move conditions from A to B and viceversa, by composition of spans

1) Backward shifters: property (19)
f is epi iff (b,f) is a backward shifer
any backward shifer is complete
examples are the two limit cases where one leg is the id (elementary)
decomposition into elementary shifters does not seem to work (find counterexample)
backward shifters compose (because pullback preserves epi)

2) Forward shifters property (18)
Any span satifies it
b epi implies shifter complete (sufficient,. probably not necessary: look for counterexample?)
decomposition into elementary shifters does not seem to work (like for forward shifting, but the counterexample can be different)
forward shifters compose 
composition of forward shifters with b epi produce a forward shifer with b epi, thus complete
open: complete forward shifters compose in general? we have only necessary condition for forward shifters... 
question: is the "partial epiness" condition that we have found necessary for completeness also sufficient?  forall h,g. b;v;g = b; h  => v;g = h. Is this property of b preserved by pullbacks?  
Fact: completeness of morphisms compose (proof by Arend quite easy using the definitions)

3) section on computable entailment should work essentially as it is, by reviting the proofs for arbitray spans commuting with v

[AC] Trying to summarise some changes agreed upon with Arend in December 2025


1) Before the encoding of ab-conditions to formulas, we claim that we can always rename node and edge identities in order to obtain an isomorphic variant. 
This is true, but it should be formalised: define formally \emph{well-formed variant}? It should be related by a family of isomorphisms where the one at the root is the identity. Explicit proof that for any two well-formed variants $c'$ and $c''$ of $c$ we have $\tofol{c'} \equiv \tofol{c''}$? 
  

2) Improve points 6 and 7 of the proof to Proposition 3.9, page 17

3) Structural morphisms of ab-conditions should be defined by using shift and pre-composition of conditions along a morphism, instead of "source shifters".
Actually, all forward and backward shifters considered in the original version are forms of pre-composition with a morphism, so using shift introduces new morphisms. 


4) Add relationship between sb-conditions and FOL formulas, along the lines of what done for ab-conditions. Define encoding of sb-conditions into for (easy) and defined logical connectives on sb-conditions.

- Extend connection from arrow-based to FOL, so readers can translate examples 
 [DONE]

- Get rid of the identity shifter if possible
 [DONE]

- Add characterisation of conjunction, disjunction, negation and existential for span-based conditions

Journal submission [after FestColloquim]
- include additionally:
  - correspondance between NGC and FOL formulas
[DONE]
  - explicit read-back: from condition to formula
[DONE]
  - from formula to conditions give a construction for and/or/not/exists
[DONE]
  - section on computable entailment 
  - I would like to get rid of I_{X,Y}, the empty shifters. 
[DONE]
- completeness for arrow based conditions - NO
- Existential quantification: relations with backward shift, properties? Adjointness? Not clear. Relation with shift????
- logical characterization of provable entailment ??? It would be nice.
