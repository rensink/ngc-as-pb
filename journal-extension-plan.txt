[AC] Trying to summarise some changes agreed upon with Arend in December 2025


1) Before the encoding of ab-conditions to formulas, we claim that we can always rename node and edge identities in order to obtain an isomorphic variant. 
This is true, but it should be formalised: define formally \emph{well-formed variant}? It should be related by a family of isomorphisms where the one at the root is the identity. Explicit proof that for any two well-formed variants $c'$ and $c''$ of $c$ we have $\tofol{c'} \equiv \tofol{c''}$? 
  

2) Improve points 6 and 7 of the proof to Proposition 3.9, page 17

3) Structural morphisms of ab-conditions should be defined by using shift and pre-composition of conditions along a morphism, instead of "source shifters".
Actually, all forward and backward shifters considered in the original version are forms of pre-composition with a morphism, so using shift introduces new morphisms. 


4) Add relationship between sb-conditions and FOL formulas, along the lines of what done for ab-conditions. Define encoding of sb-conditions into for (easy) and defined logical connectives on sb-conditions.

- Extend connection from arrow-based to FOL, so readers can translate examples 
 [DONE]

- Get rid of the identity shifter if possible
 [DONE]

- Add characterisation of conjunction, disjunction, negation and existential for span-based conditions

Journal submission [after FestColloquim]
- include additionally:
  - correspondance between NGC and FOL formulas
[DONE]
  - explicit read-back: from condition to formula
[DONE]
  - from formula to conditions give a construction for and/or/not/exists
[DONE]
  - section on computable entailment 
  - I would like to get rid of I_{X,Y}, the empty shifters. 
[DONE]
- completeness for arrow based conditions - NO
- Existential quantification: relations with backward shift, properties? Adjointness? Not clear. Relation with shift????
- logical characterization of provable entailment ??? It would be nice.
